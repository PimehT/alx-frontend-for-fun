# Flexbox

## What is Flexbox?

Flexbox is a layout model that allows elements to align and distribute space within a container. It is a one-dimensional layout model, meaning that it can deal with either rows or columns, but not both at the same time. Flexbox is designed to provide a consistent layout on different screen sizes.

## Why use Flexbox?

Flexbox is a powerful layout tool that allows you to create complex layouts with a minimal amount of CSS. It is particularly useful for creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. Flexbox is supported by all modern browsers, making it a reliable choice for web development.
